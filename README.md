Kidoz AdMob mediation adapter
</br>

**Prerequisits:**
* To use the Kidoz SDK adapter for AdMob you should make sure you have:
1. AdMob Mediation integrated in your project.
2. A fully functional AdMob ad placement.
3. Kidoz SDK built with your project.

3.1. You can get Kidoz SDK as a Gradle dependency (together with it's needed dependencies) using the following lines:
```
    compile group: 'org.greenrobot', name: 'eventbus', version: '3.0.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:23.0.+'
    compile 'com.kidoz.sdk:KidozSDK:0.8.2.1@aar'
```
3.2. Please make sure you have a set up Kidoz publisher account.
3.3. The plugin itself consists of the java files inside the 'pluginFiles' directory, copy this entire package to your own project.

3.4. Set your Kidoz PublisherId & PublisherToken in the adapter using the following:
```
KidozManager.setKidozPublisherId(<publisherId>)
KidozManager.setKidozPublisherToken(<publisherToken>)

Or set a Custom Events Parameter:

 For Banner:
 {"AppID":"publisherId", "Token":"publisherToken"}

 For Interstitial:
 {"AppID":"publisherId", "Token":"publisherToken"}

 For Rewarded Video:
 {"AppID":"publisherId", "Token":"publisherToken"}
 
```
3.5. If you want to connect directly with the Kidoz reward events use the following:
```
KidozManager.setRewardedEvents(<new BaseInterstitial.IOnInterstitialRewardedEventListener>);
```
</br>
